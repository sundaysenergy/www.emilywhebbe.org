 <title>Chocolate Chip Cookies (Gluten/grain-free)</title>
 <link>http://www.emilywhebbe.org/choc-chip-grain-free</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;These gluten-free, grain-free, peanut-free, cookies are deliciously chewy, soft, moist, and nearly 100% healthy. The only questionable ingredient is sugar (which is very little considering most cookies), and it could be replaced with honey if you like (although you&#039;ll have to add more flax if you do so). They&#039;ll last about as long as it takes to make them, which is all of 5 minutes if you&#039;re lucky enough to have a brand new Kitchen-Aid stand mixer like I have (seriously this thing is changing my life). Even if you don&#039;t have one, it will take about 20 minutes start to warm, chewy finish.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Chocolate Pudding</title>
 <link>http://www.emilywhebbe.org/chocolate-pudding</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Oh dang, I&#039;m on a roll with what shall be called &quot;recipes that need a quotation mark,&quot; or &quot;foods that would never be sold to the mainstream public,&quot; or &quot;yes I&#039;m really that much of a hippy that I made this delicious not-cake/not-pudding/sugar, grain, dairy-free food for you!&quot; Yes, I&#039;m on a downhill (but really uphill) slide (but really a ladder) into the depths (but really heights) of healthful cooking.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Grain-Free Chocolate/Sunbutter &quot;cake&quot;</title>
 <link>http://www.emilywhebbe.org/chocolate-sunbutter-cake</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;I don&#039;t usually gravitate towards recipes that have the word cake in quotation marks, or really anything that starts with a qualifier like &quot;grain-free&quot; or &quot;gluten, sugar, anything free&quot; because they usually are terrible. There, I said it. They&#039;re usually trying to be something they&#039;re not, and nothing good ever comes of anything or anyone trying to be something they&#039;re not.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Naturally Green Cookies</title>
 <link>http://www.emilywhebbe.org/green-cookies</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;I&#039;m in love with Almonds: almond butter, almond milk, almond flour; and I can&#039;t eat them. I can&#039;t let my daughter eat them either, as she has a sensitivity to them that causes her skin to react unfavorably after ingesting them. I haven&#039;t consumed cow&#039;s milk (in liquid form anyway) in over 10 years, and almond milk was always my go-to liquid other than water and coconut milk. It&#039;s a lame allergy to have, but I&#039;m (mostly) over it, and have switched to hemp milk (which I like better, but is usually more expensive), and sunflower seed butter instead of almond butter.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Finally, a banana bread recipe I like</title>
 <link>http://www.emilywhebbe.org/banana-bread</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;I&#039;ve had a love/like relationship with making banana bread for years. I love repurposing old bananas into a sweet treat (and it&#039;s even better that this treat is best served warm with butter on top), but I never get the exact texture or taste I&#039;m looking for. Maybe it was the help of Reverie that made all the difference, but this recipe will now be my standby. Basically, I&#039;m an official mom as of this moment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Banana Bread (makes 2 loaves)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1/2 cup sugar/honey/syrup (whatever you choose)&lt;br /&gt;
1/2 cup brown sugar (optional: you can omit this if you want less sugar content.)&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Savory Waffles</title>
 <link>http://www.emilywhebbe.org/savory-waffles</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Winter is a great time to spend an entire morning making breakfast. This past weekend, Kai, Reverie, and I did just that. What ensued convinced me that waffles may be the perfect vehicle to serve a variety of nutrients and favors. They prove adjustable to a variety of pallets and desires, and they&#039;re fun and easy to make (provided you have a fancy waffle iron). The following recipe was complimented by rich turmeric eggs with mushrooms and spinach, bacon, and of course, freshly whipped cream. Okay, okay, so the cream may have been over the top, but it was a nice addition nonetheless.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1 cup butter or coconut oil&lt;br /&gt;
1/2 cup sugar/sweetener of choice&lt;br /&gt;
2 T molasses&lt;br /&gt;
2 eggs&lt;br /&gt;
1/4 cup cocoa powder&lt;br /&gt;
1 teaspoon baking soda&lt;br /&gt;
Ginger&lt;br /&gt;
Nutmeg&lt;br /&gt;
Cinnamon&lt;br /&gt;
1 T vanilla&lt;br /&gt;
1 cup whole wheat flour&lt;br /&gt;
2 cups white flour&lt;br /&gt;
Chocolate chips&lt;br /&gt;
a few tablespoons of milk or coconut milk to make everything stick together&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1 cup whole wheat flour&lt;br /&gt;
1 teaspoon baking powder&lt;br /&gt;
sweetener of choice (1/4 cup honey or sugar, or nothing)&lt;br /&gt;
1 tablespoon coconut oil&lt;br /&gt;
1/2 cup coconut milk (may need more to create the right thickness)&lt;br /&gt;
1 egg&lt;br /&gt;
1-2 tablespoons flax&lt;br /&gt;
1 cup pumpkin&lt;br /&gt;
1 banana (optional)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bake in a waffle iron and eat!&lt;/p&gt;
