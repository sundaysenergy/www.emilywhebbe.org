  <div class="content">
    <p>I'm in love with Almonds: almond butter, almond milk, almond flour; and I can't eat them. I can't let my daughter eat them either, as she has a sensitivity to them that causes her skin to react unfavorably after ingesting them. I haven't consumed cow's milk (in liquid form anyway) in over 10 years, and almond milk was always my go-to liquid other than water and coconut milk. It's a lame allergy to have, but I'm (mostly) over it, and have switched to hemp milk (which I like better, but is usually more expensive), and sunflower seed butter instead of almond butter. It's not the same, not even close (I can tell because I don't find myself going to the fridge for a spoonful of sunflower seed butter like I did when almond butter was in there), but it will have to do. </p>
<p>Thus, I've been baking a lot with sunflower seed butter. It tastes very much like what I remember peanut butter to taste like (I haven't eaten peanut butter in about 3 years because peanuts usually harbor mold, and watching my dog disgustingly lick it out of her dog toy, filling the ambient air with a warm peanut butter smell turned me off of it nearly immediately), and it's good for your body (and skin since it has a lot of Vitamin E). Sunbutter also contains my favorite mineral: magnesium. You're probably deficient in magnesium, google it. But perhaps my favorite property of sunbutter, is it's ability to naturally turn baked goods green. </p>
<p>For awhile I figured I would ignore this phenomenon. I'd bake cookies with sunflower seed butter, they'd turn green...and continue to become more saturated in green coloring as they "aged." They looked weird, and although we wondered if we should continue eating them, we did (or at least I did). At first I thought it was the garbanzo beans reacting to the sunflower seed butter, as I used them in a particular cookie recipe. When every subsequent creation including sunflower seed butter resulted in the same eerie green, I decided to investigate. </p>
<p>The chlorophyll in sunflower seeds reacts with baking soda/powder. It's that simple. Sunflower seeds have chlorophyll and it's brought out by the baking soda. I can imagine this would be useful for holiday baking and when Rev gets old enough to notice, although maybe if I keep making them, she probably won't think anything is "wrong" with them. Hopefully this will quell suspicion of certain household members who were convince we were poisoning ourselves. </p>
<p>Here's the recipe for your very own green cookies:</p>
<p>1/2 cup butter or coconut oil<br />
1/2 cup sugar/sweetener of choice<br />
1/2 to 1 cup sunflower seed butter<br />
1 cup garbanzo beans (soaked, cooked, and pureed)<br />
2 eggs<br />
1 Tablespoon flax meal<br />
1 teaspoon baking soda (1/2 teaspoon and 1 tablespoon lemon juice if you don't want green)<br />
Ginger<br />
Nutmeg<br />
Cinnamon<br />
1 T vanilla<br />
1/2 cup rolled oats<br />
2 cups whole wheat flour<br />
Chocolate chips<br />
raisins<br />
a few tablespoons of milk or milk substitute to make everything stick together</p>
<p>Bake at 350 and enjoy them before they cool if you want non-green cookies. They'll turn green as they cool and even more green by the next day!</p>
